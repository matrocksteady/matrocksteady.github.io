The cracks in a spine tell their own story where each fissure becomes a part of the cartography of reading. The first crevice screaming into existence the passion of an unquenched reader begging the page to swallow them whole as they tear through each sheet.





I just love books. I think you should buy them, use them, abuse them, give them to friends, have them returned, have them not returned, forget them, lose them, smell them, display them, bathe in the stories of their words, but also in the stories of their readers. Read someone else's highlights and notes in the margins and dog-earred pages. Find their stories in between the pages and create your own and leave them for others to find.
