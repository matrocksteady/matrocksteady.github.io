Courtliness is a whole other can of worms. There is a lot of presumption right now that gendered relationships are founded on principles of inequality, but relationships with people that are sexually interested in one another have always been complicated. They are not bicameral. There is nothing simple about them. You cannot reduce them to any simple formula of dominance and submission, power and weakness.

Any two people who are sexually interested in each other have to hammer out a new treaty and every single little clause of that treaty has to be reinvented. There just isn't any boilerplate. Not if both parties are alive. I'm sure there are all kinds of people that com etogether in couplings that are just out of some manual they read, but even those.	

You cannot touch another person and have them reciprocate that touch and have it be anything that's ever happened before or will happen since. Every one of those moments is unique and the transfer of power and the transfer of rules and expectations and desires, it's all ever-new. 

So to be a gentleman or to be courtly or to be considerate or to be those things in that context requires that you know what consideration means in that situation: be vulnerable, be ready to...I guess be confident enough to bare a certain amount of humiliation all the time. That's one of the ways that you can be successful in love. Because humiliation is the thing we're all terrified of. Everyone is terrified of being humiliated.

And if you go into love and assume that you're going to suffer some humiliation here -- small or large, like every minute there is going to be something. Because it's impossible not to be embarrassed and not to feel ashamed. Unless you're a sociopath. So, to be graceful is to recognize that the other person is in this same situation but they do not want to feel humiliation and be willing to shoulder it and be willing to shoulder it. To protect them from humiliation and sometimes that means that you have to bare it. You have to feel it a little. 

That's a kind of grace that is very hard to do because humiliation is the hardest thing to bare. It's much much harder than physical pain to just feel that feeling. You can't even metaphorize it. There's no analog to humiliation. It's its own tower of suffering.

And it's very hard for me. I'm always somebody that's like "Well, I'm never gonna ask somebody to do something" because the possibility that they don't want to exists. So if they do want to, they'll let me know. And if they don't, I'm never going to ask because even asking is a form of pressure, is a form of coersion. 
And, of course, that's not generous to put on the other person all the responsibility to state their desires. You can't say, "Well I'm being polite. I'm not putting any pressure on anyone ever." Because what you're doing is saving yourself the humiliation of politely asking and being refused.

But there's responsibility. Everybody has responsibility to say "Here's what I want" but also "What do you want?" You have to do a lot of heavy lifting for people that you love if you care about them. You can't just sit there stoicly and say "It's on you because I don't feel safe anymore." Particularly when it comes to the question of consent. You cannot just say "Because I fear the appearance of intruding upon your consent, I'm just going to wait this out or I'm just going to sit here passively and leave it to you to initiate all contact, initate all choices." 

But you put yourself at risk as soon as you express a positive desire for something. As soon as you say, "This is what I would like." But those are the risks that we are obligated to one another to take. That is a form of generosity even though it seems like a form of selfishness to say what you want. It sounds selfish to
the untrained to be like, "This is what I want," but, really, that's generous. Now the other person doesn't have to guess.
And sitting with a lover and guessing what they want? It's the worst! "Do you like this?" I don't what. "What about this?" I don't know. It's like, oh boy, thank god I'm not in college anymore.
