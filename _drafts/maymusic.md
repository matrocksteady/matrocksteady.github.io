Just a List of Some Songs I've Had on Repeat Lately

I almost exclusively listen to music in album format, but every now and then a real earworm comes around and I turn click the "Repeat One" button and give something a spin multiple times in a row. This column is a list of some of those songs for me right now. Here's [the playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1265852/playlist/43c8UAhyJteiaDCSczTXWB?si=0p_Jzq5GTs6yMhhIirI1Yw).

Now, Now - "SGL"
Where the appeal of *Threads* is its brooding, synthy pop-punk riffs and KC Dalager's breathy voice getting swallowed up by huge drum beats and synth layers, "SGL" and its follow-up singles have turned Now, Now into a pop powerhouse. The song tangles up its foundational acoustic guitar riff in buzzy synth leads during the verses and leans on a stripped, swelling pre-chorus between them, dangling a refrain like a carrot on a stick before twisting itself right back into the second verse. It makes for a fun take on pop structures and keeps the song's tension high for when the refrain does arrive just over halfway through its playtime. Paired with the hookiness of nearly every melody, it makes for a song worth back-to-back listens each time I turn it on.

Pale Waves - "Television Romance"
Its an easy sell to compare Pale Waves to labelmates The 1975, which absolutely is true in all its '80s inspired indie-pop glory. "Telvision Romance" definitely sits in that funky, poppy, throwback-but-its-not-a-

Pale Waves strenght lies in their relatiolnsihp with subversion -- looking like the Cure and launching into groovy, '80s-inspired pop tunes that slur their way through slurry hooks and gloomy lyrics about being bored at parties, mediocre partners, and romantic uncertainty. It plays with expectations between aesthetic and sound and wraps itself in a tinge of irony and aloofness that makes them appealing. If they outgrow their mentors, they might be the next big pop band.

Christine and the Queens - "Tilted"
Arcade High - "Phone Lines"
Oneohtrix Point Never - "Sticky Drama"
Drake - "Nice For What"
Noname - "Diddy Bop"
