An Exhaustive Description of Tracking Every Minute of My Life

I am a crazy person and attemt to track and categorize what I am doing with every minute of my life. I have found this helps keep myself accountable because when I begin doing any activity, I have to consciously mark it down. This forces me to always consider that there is a timer running in the background and how much of the pie of my life I want filled with my current activity. 
 
Play some video games? Totally cool -- I don't want to be my own personal Productivity Tyrant. Eight hours later, though, I probably won't feel so great having to click the "stop" button on that timer. I'd like to think this helps me be more considerate to myself about how I spend my time.

That doesn't always work out, though. There have definitely been more than one or two eight or more hour video game or television timers that I've shrugged at and accepted as who I am that day. But having that data is still useful for looking back at where my life has gone.

It's easy for life to feel like it's just passing by and you're not even sure what you've been doing, but time tracking has alleviated a lot of that because I know *exactly* what I've been doing this month, even if that's just 100 hours of video games and telvision. Having that data laid out clearly has made it easy for me to have an honest answer about what I make a priority.








This then all gets fed into longer-term reports, which allow me to reflect on bigger picture trends in how I spend my time.
