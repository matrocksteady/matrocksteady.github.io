An Exhaustive Description of Tracking Every Minute of My Life

I attempt to track and categorize what I am doing with every minute of my life. Twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, there is a timer running that describes what I am doing. I have found this helps keep myself accountable for what I spend my time doing. Any time I begin doing an activity, I have to consciously mark it down. Same when I stop what I'm doing. This moment forces me to confront what I am doing--or have done--and decide if and how much time I want to spend doing it.
 
The entire point of that moment is to hopefully encourage myself to engage in more productive activities. I'm not particularly unique in that area. I hope to spend more time with the general "be a better version of myself" sort of activities: reading, writing, working out, etc. I don't want to become my own personal Productivity Tyrant, though. Play some video games? Totally cool. Click the button and go. I'm allowed to enjoy myself. Eight hours later, though, I probably won't feel so great having to click stop on that timer. So I'd like to think this helps me be more considerate to myself about how I spend my time.

That doesn't always work out, though. There have definitely been more than one or two eight or more hour video game or television timers that I've shrugged at and accepted as who I am that day. But having that data is still useful for looking back at where my life has gone.

It's easy for life to feel like it's just passing by and you're not even sure what you've been doing, but time tracking has alleviated a lot of that because I know *exactly* what I've been doing this month, even if that's just 100 hours of video games and telvision. Having that data laid out clearly has made it easy for me to have an honest answer about what I make a priority.








This then all gets fed into longer-term reports, which allow me to reflect on bigger picture trends in how I spend my time.
