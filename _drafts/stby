The moment Cassius first meets the equisapians is the moment he comes face to face with the monstrosity of the absurdity of free market absolutism ideology and flips back to the side of organizing labor. Steve Lift, the CEO of WorryFree, tries to calm him down by explaining he's going to make workers stronger and, crucially, more effiencent and obedient. He espouses how this is going to make the world a better place and that he's "not being irrational." 

This is the impersonal distance of that ideology. and it's bullshit.
