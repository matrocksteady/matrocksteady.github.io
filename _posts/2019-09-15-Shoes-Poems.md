A Facebook friend was looking for some poems about van Gogh's 'A Pair of Shoes' painting and I felt inspired, so here are a few haikus I whipped up.

Leather for the bad  
Weather, take me home, soft like  
A feather, now rest  
  
&nbsp;
Tangle untangle  
Chasing lace, these fingers dance  
Daily routine trance  
  
&nbsp;
With me all these years  
Every crevice, a story  
Dad's boots fit me now  
  
&nbsp;
Broken sole; patch me  
Let me keep you safe and warm  
So much left to give  
  
&nbsp;
Early morning rise  
Freshly oiled and ready  
For a long day's work
