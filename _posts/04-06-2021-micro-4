Scribbled in my notepad is a quote that I cannot actually locate the origins of, but states the following:

"We procrastinate when we forget who we are but also when we're struggling with admitting how much we don't like that person."

My notes follow it up saying it belongs to Federico Fellini's *8 1/2*, but I cannot seem to verify that. I haven't even seen that movie yet, though perhaps now I will make time for it. Anyway, it made me feel something.
