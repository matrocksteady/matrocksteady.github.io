I really loved Patriot's season 1 theme song, "Train Song" by Vashti Bunyan, so I looked her up and now I'm also in love with her album *[Just Another Diamond Day](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BjFznpsyrxCFMpp3hzlD2?si=u0i1GUXnRIOtNjsI8bFH4g)*. It's soft folk music that's mainly just a guitar and her voice. It feels like being hugged by someone when both of you are a little blue.
