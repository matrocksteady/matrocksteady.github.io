The AV Club on Amazon's *The Boys*:

> There is a rise in the desire and nostalgia for characters with good intentions that embrace passions and dreams rather than cynicism, because many of us want to connect with earnest emotion and unapologetic ideals to counter the weight of the world.

It's okay to want the world to be a better place and fight for that to be reality. It's okay to be genuine-genuine instead of ironic-genuine. It's okay to care. There's been enough years of wallowing in the misery of our cultural cynicism and it's time for a change. In the face of overwhelming political tension and fatigue, impending ecological collapse, and the drudgery of everyday capitalism, hope can feel like all we have left to hold onto. I think stories of hope and sincerity will be a defining moment of this era and the world will be a better place for it.
