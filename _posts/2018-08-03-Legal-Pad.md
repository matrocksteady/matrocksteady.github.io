I started writing with pen and paper again this year. I bought a [nice notebook](https://www.baronfig.com/products/shopconfidant) and a new pack of [V5s](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Precise-Precision-Ink-5mm-35334/dp/B00006IEBI) (the only pen you ever need). I wanted to give myself the space to do some slow reflection and work on finding some clarity of self and ideology. I wrote almost every day for the first few months of the year but, like many before and many to come, I eventually fell off the wagon and it's been sporadic since late April. This is a regular occurence in my hobbies. I get in my head about being overly perfect in my wording or what I'm writing about, even if it's in complete privacy, and end up paralyzing myself. I feel useless or trite any time I start writing and like I'm not making any valuable point to myself or anyone else by continuing to write. I even feel like that right this instant. And that is perhaps its own topic for another day. From this paralysis, though, I recently found one small piece of reprieve: a legal pad.

Yes, that legal pad. With the black bar at the top gluing all the pages together and yellow, legal-ruled paper with the double red line on the left. I grabbed it randomly on my way to a meeting one day at work several weeks ago because I couldn't find the notebook I usually use and knew I needed to jot down some notes. I took down what I needed, transferred from there to OneNote and my to-dos as usual and went about my day.
