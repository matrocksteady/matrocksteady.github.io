Due to the current political climate and my burgeoning leftism, I've been revisiting Saul Alinsky's *Rules for Radicals* this week. During the prologue, he quotes a snippet from a letter John Adams wrote in 1818 that I find useful right now:

> "The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people...This radical change in principles, opinions, sentiments, and affection of the people, was the real American Revolution."

I'm plagued by fear and self doubt every time I pick up a pen, but Adams' quote reminds me that discourse is an important part in changing the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of others so we can create a climate where revolutionary ideas can grow. To do that, I can't let myself get hung up by my shortcomings. I'd never publish anything or help create the change I so badly want to see in the world. 

No raindrop pleads guilty to causing the flood, but we do need a lot of raindrops to make that flood. So write your hot takes and your takedowns and your think pieces and your diatribes â€” write your truth, whatever that is. Your ideas are valuable and matter and can change the world, one raindrop at a time.
