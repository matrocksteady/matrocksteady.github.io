Midwestern mammal. I'm an engineering manager for a software company. I mostly write about how I use technology, media I think is fun or has something interesting to say, and leftist politics.

This is my home on the internet, but you can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/matrocksteady), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matrocksteady), [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nd6f88F), [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67383325-matthew), and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9408242).

If you want to get in touch privately, you can email me at matrocksteady [at] gmail [dot] com.
